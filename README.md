### Nice to have: 
These features may be included in future releases of this application.
* In future releases, put a limit on how many reviews a single user can put on a particular product.
* Access so admin can moderate reviews with ability to delete them from the admin panel.
* User blogs to share stories or ask for advice on keeping bees.
* The ability to decide whether you want to actually delete a product after pressing the delete button.


### Cross Browser Compatibility
Tested on four Browsers
* Chrome, No Errors works as intended.  
* Opera, No Errors works as intended.
* Firefox, The firefox browser struggled with css with pointer hover stuggling on the landing page. Some tables also struggle with positioning.  
* Edge, The Edge browser did not like a lot of the css and the pointer hover caused strange movement in the user interface. Some forms and tables 
do not render in the correct places, however the loading time was fast and smooth.


## Bugs & ongoing fixes
* On the crispy forms image input I have yet to find a way to style the call to action buttons for uploading images. In the next release I will have styled these buttons.
* The sign up form atomatically auto focuses on user name instead of email.
* The product admin page on smaller screens is not quite as constrained as I would like. However it does not affect the usability of the page just the aesthetics.
* Compatibilty is poor on 2 of the mainstream browers so css fixes will be made in future releases of the application.
